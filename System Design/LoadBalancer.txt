Features
- Distribute incoming traffic to netwrok by efficiently distributing across multiple servers
    - Redistribute load amongs other servers
- Reliability & High Availability is maintained by redirecting request only to servers available.
    - Service is always running because if one server is down request will go to other running servers.
-Ease of use in adding and removing servers in the netwrok as per demand.
    - Allow easy adding servers (X-mas requires more server running)

Load Balancing Algorithms
-Round Robin
    - Sequential request distribution ( 1, 2, 3, 4) = follows an order
-Least connection
    - Request sent to the least used server in the network 
        - Get information from servers to give to one with least connection
-IP Hash
    - Request sent to the server based on Client IP
        - Specific servers needs to be given preference over others

Sticky Sessions
    - Keep a sessionId direct to server 1 so every time this sessionid makes a request it goes to same server 1 ( sticky session)
