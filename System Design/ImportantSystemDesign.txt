Scalability
    - Vertical scaling
    - Horizontal scaling
    - Caching
    - Load balancing
    - Database replication
    - Database partitioning
Topics covered:
    Clones
    Databases
    - MySQL, SQL -
        - master-slave replication (read from slaves, write to master)
        - Needs to start introduce sharding
        - Joins are expensive
    - Change from SQL to NoSQL
        - Performance increases since no joins required 
        - Soon getting data will be slow and you need to introduce Caching
    Caches
        - in memory cache - Memcached or Redis
        - Cache - simple key-value store 
        - resides as buffering layer between application and data storage
        - Cache is lighting-fast so you should check before going to Database
        Patterns of Caching Data
            - Cached Database Queries
                - Saving queries result into cache
                - Problem: When a piece of data changes (table cell) you will need to delete all cache queries that include that table cell.
            - Cached Objects
                - Saving instance as objects makes it easy to get back and delete from cache
    Asynchronism
        - The frontend of your website sends a job onto a job queue and immediately signals back to the user: your job is in work, please continue to the browse the page. 
        - The job queue is constantly checked by a bunch of workers for new jobs. If there is a new job then the worker does the job and after some minutes sends a signal that the job was done. 
        - RabbitMQ
            -one of many systems which help to implement async processing

Performance vs Scalability

A service is scalable if it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.

Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user.
If you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

Latency vs Throughput
Latency is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.

Throughput is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.

Generally, you should aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency.

Availability vs consistency
CAP Theorem
In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:

Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
Availability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
Partition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures
Networks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance. You'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.

CP - consistency and partition tolerance
Waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error. CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.

AP - availability and partition tolerance
Responses return the most recent version of the data available on a node, which might not be the latest. Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.

AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for eventual consistency or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.


Consistency patterns
With multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data. Recall the definition of consistency from the CAP theorem - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

Weak consistency
After a write, reads may or may not see it. A best effort approach is taken.

This approach is seen in systems such as memcached. Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games. For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.

Eventual consistency
After a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds). Data is replicated asynchronously.

This approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email. Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.

Strong consistency
After a write, reads will see it. Data is replicated synchronously.

This approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes. Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.

Availability patterns
There are two main patterns to support high availability: fail-over and replication.

Fail-over
Active-passive
With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby. If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.

The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standby or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby. Only the active server handles traffic.

Active-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.

Active-active
In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.

If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers. If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.

Active-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.

Disadvantage(s): failover
Fail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.
There is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.
Replication
Master-slave and master-master
This topic is further discussed in the Database section:

Master-slave replication
Master-master replication
Availability in numbers
Availability is often quantified by uptime (or downtime) as a percentage of time the service is available. Availability is generally measured in number of 9s--a service with 99.99% availability is described as having four 9s.

99.9% availability - three 9s
Duration	Acceptable downtime
Downtime per year	8h 45min 57s
Downtime per month	43m 49.7s
Downtime per week	10m 4.8s
Downtime per day	1m 26.4s
99.99% availability - four 9s
Duration	Acceptable downtime
Downtime per year	52min 35.7s
Downtime per month	4m 23s
Downtime per week	1m 5s
Downtime per day	8.6s
Availability in parallel vs in sequence
If a service consists of multiple components prone to failure, the service's overall availability depends on whether the components are in sequence or in parallel.

In sequence
Overall availability decreases when two components with availability < 100% are in sequence:

Availability (Total) = Availability (Foo) * Availability (Bar)
If both Foo and Bar each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in sequence would be 99.8%.

In parallel
Overall availability increases when two components with availability < 100% are in parallel:

Availability (Total) = 1 - (1 - Availability (Foo)) * (1 - Availability (Bar))
If both Foo and Bar each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in parallel would be 99.9999%.

Domain name system

A Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address.

DNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level. Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup. Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays. DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the time to live (TTL).

NS record (name server) - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.
MX record (mail exchange) - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.
A record (address) - Points a name to an IP address.
CNAME (canonical) - Points a name to another name or CNAME (example.com to www.example.com) or to an A record.
Services such as CloudFlare and Route 53 provide managed DNS services. Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:

Weighted round robin
Prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance
Balance between varying cluster sizes
A/B testing
Latency-based
Geolocation-based
Disadvantage(s): DNS
Accessing a DNS server introduces a slight delay, although mitigated by caching described above.
DNS server management could be complex and is generally managed by governments, ISPs, and large companies.
DNS services have recently come under DDoS attack, preventing users from accessing websites such as Twitter without knowing Twitter's IP address(es).

Content Delivery Network
A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user. Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content. The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.

Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:

Users receive content at data centers close to them
Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills
Push CDNs
Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server. You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN. You can configure when content expires and when it is updated. Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.

Sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't often updated work well with push CDNs. Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.

Pull CDNs
Pull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content. You leave the content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN. This results in a slower request until the content is cached on the CDN.

A time-to-live (TTL) determines how long content is cached. Pull CDNs minimize storage space on the CDN, but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed.

Sites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.

Disadvantage(s): CDN
CDN costs could be significant depending on traffic, although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a CDN.
Content might be stale if it is updated before the TTL expires it.
CDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN.

Load Balancer

Load balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases. In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client. Load balancers are effective at:

Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers
Preventing overloading resources
Helping eliminate single points of failure
Load balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy.

Additional benefits include:

SSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations
Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server
Session persistence - Issue cookies and route a specific client's requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions
To protect against failures, it's common to set up multiple load balancers, either in active-passive or active-active mode.

Load balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:

Random
Least loaded
Session/cookies
Round robin or weighted round robin
Layer 4
Layer 7
Layer 4 load balancing
Layer 4 load balancers look at info at the transport layer to decide how to distribute requests. Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet. Layer 4 load balancers forward network packets to and from the upstream server, performing Network Address Translation (NAT).

Layer 7 load balancing
Layer 7 load balancers look at the application layer to decide how to distribute requests. This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies. Layer 7 load balancers terminates network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server. For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.

At the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.
Horizontal scaling
Load balancers can also help with horizontal scaling, improving performance and availability. Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called Vertical Scaling. It is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems.

Disadvantage(s): horizontal scaling
Scaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers
Servers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures
Sessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a database (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent cache (Redis, Memcached)
Downstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out
Disadvantage(s): load balancer
The load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly.
Introducing a load balancer to help eliminate single points of failure results in increased complexity.
A single load balancer is a single point of failure, configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity.
