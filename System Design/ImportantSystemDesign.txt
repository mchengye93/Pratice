Scalability
    - Vertical scaling
    - Horizontal scaling
    - Caching
    - Load balancing
    - Database replication
    - Database partitioning
Topics covered:
    Clones
    Databases
    - MySQL, SQL -
        - master-slave replication (read from slaves, write to master)
        - Needs to start introduce sharding
        - Joins are expensive
    - Change from SQL to NoSQL
        - Performance increases since no joins required 
        - Soon getting data will be slow and you need to introduce Caching
    Caches
        - in memory cache - Memcached or Redis
        - Cache - simple key-value store 
        - resides as buffering layer between application and data storage
        - Cache is lighting-fast so you should check before going to Database
        Patterns of Caching Data
            - Cached Database Queries
                - Saving queries result into cache
                - Problem: When a piece of data changes (table cell) you will need to delete all cache queries that include that table cell.
            - Cached Objects
                - Saving instance as objects makes it easy to get back and delete from cache
    Asynchronism
