1. Database
    - SQL vs. NoSQL
    - Queries
2. Load balancer
    - Common technique layer 4 - networking layer 
        - Load balance based on packages received
        - Take a look at IP address and 
        - Health check
            - Pings server to check if they are ok
            - Latency now where they are located
        - Round robin
            - Send request to all servers that are available
            - Downside: first two overloaded with traffic it will still send because it is their turn
        - Least connection
            - Forward to those are have low number of connections
        - State between multiple request
            - Load balancer keep state and forward request to same backend server
        -Source algorithm
            - Load balancer picks hask function based on available backend servers

    - Layer 7
        - Load balancer is aware HTTP protocol and look into header and make decisions
        - Advantage: load balancer will be able to load request to same backend
    - DNS load balancing
        - URL to an IP address make decision to where you route this
        - Google uses this to reroute to closest server
3. Async workers
4. Distributed system
5. HDFS
    - 
6. Spark
