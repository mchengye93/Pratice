/*
Given grantsArray, return a new cap that will minimize grants affected

input:  grantsArray = [2, 100, 50, 120, 1000], newBudget = 190

output: 47 # and given this cap the new grants array would be
           # [2, 47, 47, 47, 47]. Notice that the sum of the
           # new grants is indeed 190
